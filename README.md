# JavaScript-Q22
What is the Temporal Dead Zone? 
The Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs when declaring a variable with the let and const keywords, but not with var. In ECMAScript 6, accessing a let or const variable before its declaration (within its scope) causes a ReferenceError. The time span when that happens, between the creation of a variableâ€™s binding and its declaration, is called the temporal dead zone.

Let's see this behavior with an example,

let counter = 1;
switch (x) {
  case 0:
    let name;
    break;

  case 1:
    let name; // SyntaxError for redeclaration.
    break;
}

To avoid this error, you can create a nested block inside a case clause and create a new block scoped lexical environment.

let counter = 1;
switch (x) {
  case 0: {
    let name;
    break;
  }
  case 1: {
    let name; // No SyntaxError for redeclaration.
    break;
  }
}
